Certainly! Here are 20 steps to create a Simple Calculator with Error Handling in Ruby:

1. **Define Requirements**:
List the functionalities you want in your calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

2. **Setup Development Environment**:
Ensure Ruby is installed, and choose a text editor or IDE suitable for Ruby development.

3. **Create Project Directory**:
Create a directory for your calculator project. This is where all your files will be stored.

4. **Create Ruby File**:
Within your project directory, create a Ruby file (e.g., `simple_calculator.rb`).

5. **Define a Module**:
In your Ruby file, define a module (e.g., `Calculator`) to encapsulate all calculator-related methods.

6. **Define Basic Methods**:
Inside the module, define methods for basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

7. **Input Validation**:
Within each method, implement input validation to ensure that the inputs are numbers.

8. **Handle Division by Zero**:
In the division method, handle cases where the divisor is zero to prevent errors.

9. **Implement method_missing**:
Inside the module, define a `method_missing` method to catch calls to undefined methods.

10. **Suggest Valid Operations**:
In the `method_missing` method, display an error message and suggest valid operations when an undefined operation is called.

11. **Create a User Interface**:
Outside the module, write code to interact with the user. Ask for the operation they want to perform and the numbers they want to operate on.

12. **Parse User Input**:
Parse the userâ€™s input to identify the operation and numbers.

13. **Call Appropriate Method**:
Use the parsed information to call the appropriate method within the Calculator module.

14. **Display Result**:
Output the result of the operation to the user.

15. **Error Handling**:
Implement error handling for invalid input types and values. Communicate the errors gracefully to the user.

16. **Loop for Continuous Calculation**:
Implement a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the application.

17. **Exit Option**:
Provide an option for the user to exit the application.

18. **Test**:
Thoroughly test your calculator to ensure all functionalities work as expected and that error handling is properly implemented.

19. **Document Your Code**:
Add comments to your code explaining what different sections and methods do.

20. **Review and Refactor**:
Review your code for any improvements in readability, structure, or logic and make necessary refinements.

Once you've followed these steps, you'll have a Simple Calculator with Error Handling.
Make sure to frequently save your work and possibly use a version control system like Git to track your changes.
