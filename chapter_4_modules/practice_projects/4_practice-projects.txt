Certainly! Here are five beginner-friendly projects that focus on fundamental concepts in Ruby,
particularly modules and program organization:

1. **Simple Calculator with Error Handling**:
Create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
Utilize modules to encapsulate the calculator functions, and use the `method_missing` to handle any undefined
operations gracefully by displaying an error message or suggesting valid operations.

2. **Basic To-do List Manager**:
Develop a command-line to-do list manager where you can add tasks, mark them as completed, and view the list.
Utilize modules to separate different functionalities such as adding, marking, and displaying tasks.

3. **File Type Organizer**:
Create a script that organizes files in a directory into subdirectories based on their file types
(e.g., all images go into an "Images" folder).
Use modules to encapsulate the logic for identifying file types and moving files.

4. **Simple Quiz Application**:
Create a quiz application where users can answer multiple-choice questions.
Utilize modules to store questions and answers, and classes to manage the user’s responses and score.

5. **Basic Expense Tracker**: Build an expense tracker where users can input expenses and view the total expenses.
Use modules to separate functionalities like adding an expense, calculating the total, and displaying the expenses.

For all these projects, beginners should focus on writing clean and organized code.
It’s important to practice using modules to encapsulate functionality and understand how they can be used to
structure a program. Additionally, beginners should seek to understand the flow of data within the program,
how methods are called, and how objects interact with modules and classes.
